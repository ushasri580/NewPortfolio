My Personal Developer Portfolio ✨
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the code behind my little corner of the internet.

This isn't just a university project for me; it's my personal playground for exploring new web technologies, diving into UI/UX design, and figuring out how to blend creative ideas with code. I wanted to build more than just a static page—I wanted to create an experience.

So, what makes this portfolio special?
I had a ton of fun adding some features that I thought were pretty cool:

🎨 A Theme That Breathes: This is my favorite part! The entire color scheme of the website changes based on your local time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night). It was a fun challenge with CSS variables!

☀️ Sun or Moon? You Decide!: Of course, I had to add a classic light/dark mode toggle. Your choice gets saved in your browser, so it'll remember you next time you visit.

📱 Works on Any Device: I spent a lot of time making sure the design is fully responsive, right down to a custom hamburger menu for mobile.

💡 Interactive Skills: Instead of a boring list, my skills are shown as clickable "glyphs." Give one a click to see my proficiency!

🎬 Cinematic Project Details: When you click on a project, it opens up in a clean modal window, kind of like watching a movie scene, so you don't have to leave the page.

My Learning Journey Through This Project 🧠
Building this portfolio taught me a lot. Here are some of my key takeaways:

Mastering CSS Variables: The dynamic theming system forced me to get really comfortable with CSS custom properties. It felt like giving my code superpowers!

Deep Dive into JavaScript: I moved from basic scripting to handling complex DOM manipulation for the theme switcher, interactive skills, and project modals.

The Importance of Mobile-First Design: Making everything look good on a tiny screen first and then scaling up was a game-changer for my design process.

🛠️ Tech Stack
This project was a deep dive into the fundamentals. Everything is built from scratch with:

HTML5 (Semantic and clean)

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, and lots of animations!)

JavaScript (ES6+) (For all the interactive magic)
